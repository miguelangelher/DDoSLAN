# DDoSLAN
Python script to run a DDoS simulation using the free IP addresses of your LAN

This scripts aims to be a useful tool to check how your server or your defence mechanisms are perfoming against distributed denial of service attacks. The main difference with other tools is that using DDoSLAN you can just simply run the attack without a point to point connection
